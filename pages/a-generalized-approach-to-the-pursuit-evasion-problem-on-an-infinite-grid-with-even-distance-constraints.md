# A Generalized Approach to the Pursuit-Evasion Problem on an Infinite Grid with Even-Distance Constraints

**Abstract** - This paper presents an in-depth analysis of the pursuit-evasion problem on an infinite grid, where a thief tries to escape from multiple police officers, and the initial taxicab distance between them is even. We explore the optimal strategies for both the thief and the police officers, considering their positions and distances in terms of taxicab geometry. We provide a generalized solution to the problem and demonstrate its effectiveness through various examples and simulations.

## 1. Introduction

### 1.1. Background and motivation

The pursuit-evasion problem has been a topic of interest in various fields such as robotics, game theory, and computer science. In this problem, a thief tries to escape from multiple police officers on an infinite grid, with the constraint that the initial taxicab distance between them is even. This constraint adds an additional layer of complexity to the problem, making it more challenging and interesting to study.

### 1.2. Problem definition with even-distance constraints

In this paper, we focus on the pursuit-evasion problem on an infinite grid, where a thief and multiple police officers move according to the following rules:

- The thief and police officers can only move horizontally or vertically, not diagonally.
- The thief moves one square per turn, followed by each police officer moving one square per turn.
- The initial taxicab distance between the thief and each police officer is even.

The objective is to determine whether the thief can avoid being captured by the police officers, given their intelligent and strategic movements.

### 1.3. Overview of the proposed approach

To tackle this problem, we perform an in-depth analysis of the optimal strategies for both the thief and the police officers, considering their positions and distances in terms of taxicab geometry. We then propose a generalized solution to the problem and demonstrate its effectiveness through various examples and simulations. Furthermore, we discuss the algorithm for determining optimal strategies, provide theorems and proofs, and analyze the complexity of our approach.

This paper is organized as follows: Section 2 reviews related work on pursuit-evasion problems, taxicab geometry, and game theory. Section 3 introduces preliminary concepts and definitions. Section 4 presents the analysis of the pursuit-evasion problem with even-distance constraints. Section 5 proposes a generalized solution to the problem. Section 6 discusses the simulation and results, and Section 7 concludes the paper and suggests future research directions.

## 2. Theoretical Background

### 2.1. Pursuit-evasion problems in different settings

Pursuit-evasion problems have been widely studied in various settings, including continuous and discrete spaces, and with different types of pursuers and evaders[^chung2008]. Some well-known pursuit-evasion games include the lion and man problem[^littlewood1951], the princess and monster game[^alpern1993], and the Cops and Robbers game[^quilliot1978]. These problems have applications in fields such as robotics, surveillance, and network security[^kolling2016].

### 2.2. Taxicab geometry and its applications

Taxicab geometry, also known as Manhattan geometry, is a form of non-Euclidean geometry where the distance between two points is defined as the sum of the absolute differences of their coordinates[^krause2002]. This geometry is particularly useful for problems involving grid-based environments, such as urban planning, transportation networks, and pathfinding algorithms[^sadovnichiy2017]. In the context of pursuit-evasion games, taxicab geometry provides a natural way to model the movements of the agents on a grid.

### 2.3. Game theory and optimization techniques

Game theory is a mathematical framework for analyzing strategic interactions between rational decision-makers[^osborne1994]. It has been used to study various aspects of pursuit-evasion problems, including the existence of optimal strategies, the value of the game, and the convergence of iterative algorithms[^basar1999]. Optimization techniques, such as linear programming, dynamic programming, and graph search algorithms, have also been applied to solve pursuit-evasion problems and find optimal strategies for the agents[^paruchuri2008].

In this paper, we build upon the existing literature on pursuit-evasion problems, taxicab geometry, and game theory to develop a generalized approach for the pursuit-evasion problem on an infinite grid with even-distance constraints.
